# Hangman the Game!

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of Hangman the game in Java. 
Here the user picks a word, and the Computer tries to gues the word.
This is a text-based, in-terminal game that uses a corpus of words to determine the best choice of letters.
The corpus of words can be found [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt).

## Playing the Game
All instructions are included in the terminal.
Instructions include:
* Think of a word and enter the number of letters in that word:
* The rules are simple. I'll guess a letter that is in the word.  If I'm right, you tell me 'yes', and where that letter is. If I'm wrong you tell me 'no'. I have 5 guesses to get it right.
* Did I guess right? (yes or no)
* Where does the letter go? (Use commas (,) to separate multiple answers.)
